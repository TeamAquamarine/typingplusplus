Your team's name (if you want one)
- Team Aquamarime 

Your team's members
- Alex Hanson, Connor Crossley, Sharon Miller, Megan Ivey

Your project's name and concept
- Typing ++ - a typing app for developers to improve their code typing dexterity.

A diagram of your project's domain model (we'll do a sample in class)

TIP: Use pencil and paper to diagram and sketch. Online tools look snazzy but take some time to learn.
